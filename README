Firestr (Pronounced Fire Star) 0.1
===================================================================

This is not the web. Firestr in short, is a distributed, 
decentralized way to communicate and share through running programs.

You don't send a message to someone, you send an program (RPC style or fully embedded code and data in some sort of bundle?), which 
can have rich content (VERY rich, alongside with viruses, malware, spyware, worms, etc...) . All programs are wired up together automatically
providing distributed communication, either through text, images, videos, 
or games. (Do you really want to be responsible for distributing other people's code?  this is a legal nightmare, before we dive into the technical bits)

The source code to all applications is available immediately to 
instantly clone and modify. ( so ARBITRARY code modification... like mailing your shadow file, or opening a socket to a remote command and control program)

===================================================================
WARNING
===================================================================

The software is in development. There is NO security (correct) and therefore
use this AT YOUR OWN RISK. (as this is a malware distribution system so far)

The software will eventually have only encrypted communication but
as of now it does not.

If you are a security expert, please contribute.

===================================================================
Organization
===================================================================

This is the reference implementation of the protocol. It uses QT for
the GUI and a custom message back-end. Currently the applications
are written in Lua, but other bindings will be provided in the future. 

The main directory is src. Each subdirectory is a library and
the main application is in src/firestr

The project uses CMake as the meta-build configuration.

===================================================================
