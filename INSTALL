Building Firestr
===================================================================

Firestr uses CMake for it's meta-build configuration.

> mkdir build
> cd build
> cmake 
> make -j

Running Firestr
===================================================================

There are two ways to have two or more instances of Firestr connect
to each other. 

If you are on a local network and only want to communicate within 
the local network, you can simply run firestr executable in your
build directory

When you add a contact, choose the local ip option and simply put
in the ip/port of the other running instance. The other user will
have to confirm your request to add their contact. Once confirmed
you can start communicating and using Firestr.

If you want to communicate over the internet via p2p, you have to 
first have to add a public firegreet instance to your greeter list
under the contact menu.

Then you can create an invite file which you can send to the person
you want to connect with. (translate to security geek speak:  offer
your public key) They can then add you as a contact via the
invite file (add to 'known_hosts' equivalent if you're familiar 
with SSH). They will then also create an invite file to send to 
you. (they must give you their public key). After you add them, 
firestr should automatically connect you and your contact via the
firegreet service.  (this is to be done best with some sort of SSL)

The firegreet service is simply responsible for providing information
to the parties on their public ip/port after which firestr will 
initiate a p2p connection.

Once a contact is added, they are saved as your contact and you will
connect to them the next time you start the application automatically.
(you also want to check a key/cert revokation list in case it's gone
funky)

You can have multiple contacts and multiple greeters. Once you have
a contact to communicate with, you can initiate a session and start
chatting or sharing applications.

Have fun.
